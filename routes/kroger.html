        Kroger is an American supermarket chain, based in Cincinnati, Ohio. I currently work here as a mobile UX designer and researcher for the checkout space.

      <h5>Process</h5>
      For every new feature, my team and I will run a Discovery sprint together. (Team: UI designer, project manager, an Android tech lead, and an iOS tech lead)
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>First day we will all look at several different data reports to get an idea about what problem we should solve. If we do not have any quantitative data I will run a few different surveys, focus groups, usability test, or click test ahead of time. After listening to several experts and reviewing available data, we will choose a manageable piece of work by the end of the day.</li>
          <li>Second day we will all look at different competitors and talk about what we like about them.</li>
          <li>Third day we all sketch out ideas on how we think the feature should look and interact. Towards the end of the day, we all vote on part of the sketches we like and I take it back for prototyping.</li>
          <li>Fourth day I will create a prototype on Invision, put a script together, and recruit users for testing.</li>
          <li>Fifth day my team and I will run usability tests. After user testing, the team and I will review the results. We make a decision on starting on final mocks or seeing if we need to make slight changes for another round of testing.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Once Discovery is over I work alongside developers to make sure the user flow works as intended.</p>
      <p>
        My team and I have redone all of the checkout and have decreased the number of pages a user has to interact with, decreased the number of error messages, decreased fallout, and added accessibility.

        On one of the past discoveries, after reviewing some qualitative data, my team noticed that users felt they needed more information about their order before paying. We added key pieces about their order on the page and did a complete redesign of the UI. We ran several rounds or surveys as well as card sorting to figure out the information hierarchy. Once testing was complete we did usability testing on several different prototypes. Once we decided what to do it went straight to development.
