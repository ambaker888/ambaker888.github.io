        Verified is a web-based app that is used to discover new restaurants, search for restaurants you want to try, and share restaurant recommendations with your friends. On this project I'm not just creating a cohesive user experience, I'm also teach the client how to do user research.
        <h5>Objective</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a prototype to show to possible investors.</li>
          <li>Find out if the app idea is something people want and find a way to present that data.</li>
          <li>Confirm if hypothesis on client's user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Process</h5>
          I recently just finished reading Lean UX for Startups. Since the client was eager to find ways to create a better user experience and didn't have a large budget, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to use the Lean UX practice.
        <p>
          The first thing Lean UX pushes for is, see if your idea is solving a problem. The client and I tried to determine
          this via survey and user interviews. The survey had questions about user's pain points when finding a restaurant and the current apps they use to solve that.
          We also grabbed demographic data so we could get an idea of the users we are trying to solve for. After the survey was created we sent it out to people we knew as well as foodie Facebook pages and foodie Meetup pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finding people's problems and confirming some hypothesis. We decided to create a journey map based off what the
          client wanted tand what customers wanted. We focused only on things that could be done for MVP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the client and I are in the process of finding out if our product solves the restaurant searching problem. We are in the very early stages of sketching and wireframing.
          The goal is to keep features at a minimum and have the user tell us what they expect during usability testing.
