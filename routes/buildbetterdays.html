        <h5>Process</h5>
        With the client wanting a complete redesign I wanted to work with them on defining their business goals and seeing who were their competitors were. After the discovery phase, we worked together on restructuring the mission, values, and purpose.  Once those items were identified I was able to do a redesign of the logo and help them with the overall content of the site.
        <p>
        Based off some of the analytics the client had on the older site I was able to identify what pages were being hit and not.  I created a card sorting to help them restructure the navigation as well as eliminate pages that weren't useful.  We created a sitemap together so I could start the process of creating a customer journey map with wireframes and content.
        </p>
        Once the wireframes were complete I started designing the site for the client and we would continuoisly check in with each other to make sure the site was going as planned.


        <h5>Roles</h5>
        I completely led the project from beginning to end with the client.  I did branding, helped restructure the content, and implemented it all on Wix for them.  Once everything was implemented on Wix we went through several training session to ensure they felt comfortable on the CMS.
