        Cordata wanted a complete revamp of their existing UI and wanted to create an application that could be used across multiple specialties.
        <h5>Objective</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a site that was user friendly for nurses, providers, and people that did not have a health care backround.</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>Process</h5>
      Before starting the new redesign my first step was to gather user feedback on the older application from customer support, anaylitics, and small group usablity testing with current nurse navigators.
      <p>
        After gathering the data I would work closely with the stakeholders and nurse navigators on wireframes for the client journey.  I did several remote A/B test with navigators as well as usability testing on wireframes for content and navigation.  After each feature went through testing and approval I would work closely with a developer to see what adjustments I would have to make for the feature.
      </p>
        Once the features were implemented in a staging environment we would do a benchmark test with some of the nurse navigators. After a few adjustments and the sprint was completed we would push out to production.  Things would get fixed off of customer support feedback as well as training calls.
      <p>
        Few months after the completion of the application I was been able to do a couple client interviews.  I mostly did naturalistic observational studying but there were times I was able to ask them to complete a task for me.  I had data on some of the tasks they found difficult ahead of time so I already had a list of things I wanted them to complete.
       </p>
        Currently, we make new features based on feedback from customer support. Every week I will listen in on training calls, demos, and check in calls to gather even more feedback on features.  Every week we will work with stakeholders every step of the way to make sure things are working as planned.

      <h5>Roles</h5>
      I currently work here and the roles I take on are designer, usability specialist, and part-time quality analysist person. I also help with the developemet of the site using HTML and Sass.
