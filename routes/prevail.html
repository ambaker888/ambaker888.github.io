        <h5>Process</h5>
        When starting this project I met several times with the stakeholders to get an idea of the business goals for the application.  As well as an idea of who they thought the competition was in the market.
        <p>
        After gathering information from the stakeholders my next step was to do a problem discovery test for what was already created for the application. This was conducted with 3 people in a moderated in-person environment. After the test, we were able to fix and create new feature functions off the data gathered.
        </p>
        Once the redesign of the application got started every feature would be tested with an A/B test and some form of comparative competition test.  Most of these test would include an individual or several just depended on the availability at the time.

        <h5>Roles</h5>
        Other than user research and usability testing, I also did the design.  Most of the mockups were done in HTML and CSS on put on a Heroku instance.  There was already a style guide in place with some Angular components that I was able to easily copy off of for my javascript needs.
