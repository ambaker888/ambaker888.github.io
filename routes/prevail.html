        <h5>Process</h5>
        When starting this project I met several times with the stakeholders to get an idea of the business goals and who the target audience was for the application. I also wanted to get an idea of their perception about the competition in the market.
        <p>
        My next step was to conduct a problem discovery test for the existing application. This was conducted with three people in a moderated environment. Based on the results of this test, we were able to fix major problems with the existing application and create several new features.
        </p>
        Once the redesign of the application got started every feature was tested with an A/B test and some form of comparative competition test.

        <h5>Roles</h5>
        In addition to user research and usability testing, I also did the design. Most of the mockups were done in HTML and CSS on put on a Heroku instance. There was already a style guide in place with some Angular components; I was able to use this for my javascript needs.
