        <h5>Process</h5>
        This project is still in the very ealry stages but I've been working on a discovery stage with the client.  Currently we are definging his business goals, values, brand, and mission.  We have both been doing competitive research as well as meeting with several charities who would want to join in on the project.  I've been asking several questions to charities as well as sending charities on what their pain points are in hopes we can help them out.
        <p>
        From the data that we have already collected we are creating content for the application and what functionality needs to be included. Wireframes have been created for the "need a hand" side and I have been doing a few small in person benchmark testing with random participants.
        </p>
        <h5>Roles</h5>
        I have been completely leading this project from usability, design, and marketing.
