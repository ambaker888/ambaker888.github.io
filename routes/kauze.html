        This client, came to me with a desire to create an application that was based on the notion of community helping community. It wanted to develop an app that allowed a person or a charity help someone out, or to help a person who is needing help find out where they might go.

        <h5>Process</h5>
        This project is still in the very early stages. Currently we are defining the business goals, values, brand, and mission. We have both been doing research to determine of similar ventures have been launched, and we have met with several charities who might want to join the project.
        <p>
        From the data that we are collecting we are slowly starting to create content for the application as well as create personas of the target user. While content is being created I have been creating a customer map with the client for ideas on basic functionality.

        Sketches of wireframes have been created for the "need a hand" side based off the research and mapping.
        <p>
        I have been doing some small group in-person benchmark testing with random participants.
