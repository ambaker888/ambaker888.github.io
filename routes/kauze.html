        This client, came to me with a desire to create an application that was based on the notion of community helping community. It wanted to develop an app that allowed a person or a charity help someone out, or to help a person who is needing help find out where they might go.

        <h5>Process</h5>
        This project is still in the very early stages but I've been working on a discovery stage with the client. Currently we are defining the business goals, values, brand, and mission. We have both been doing research to determine of similar ventures have been launched, and we have met with several charities who might want to join the project.
        <p>
        From the data that we have already collected we are creating content for the application and working out the functionality that needs to be included. Wireframes have been created for the "need a hand" side and I have been doing some in-person benchmark testing with random participants.
        </p>
        <h5>Roles</h5>
        I have been leading this project with respect to usability, design, and marketing.
