        <h5>Process</h5>
        Since the client sought a complete redesign, I first wanted to work with them on defining their business goals and determining if other non-profits were operating in the same space. We worked together on restructuring the organizationâ€™s mission, values, and purpose. Once those items were identified I was able to redesign the logo and help them with the overall content of the site.
        <p>
        Based on some of the analytics the client had on the original site I was able to identify which pages were being hit and which were not. I created a card sorting system to help them restructure the navigation as well as eliminate pages that weren't useful. We created a sitemap together so I could start the process of creating a customer journey map with wireframes and content.
        </p>
        Once the wireframes were complete I started designing the site for the client and we  continuously checked in with each other to make sure the site was going as planned.

        <h5>Roles</h5>
        I led the project from beginning to end with the client. I did branding, helped restructure the content, and implemented it all on Wix for them. Once everything was implemented on Wix we went through several training session to ensure they felt comfortable on the CMS.
