        Cordata, a nurse navigation application wanted a complete revamp of its existing UI.  I was asked to create an application that could be used across multiple specialties.

        <h5>Objective</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a site that was user friendly for nurses and other health care providers, as well as individuals who did not have a health care background.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12">
      <h5>Process</h5>
      My first step was to gather user feedback on the existing application from customer support, analytics, and small group usability testing with nurse navigators.
      <p>
      After gathering this data I worked closely with the stakeholders and nurse navigators on wireframes for the client journey. I did several remote A/B tests with navigators as well as usability testing on wireframes for content and navigation. After each feature went through testing and approval I worked closely with a developer to make necessary refinements.
      </p>
        Once the features were implemented in a staging environment we conducted benchmark tests with some of the nurse navigators. After refinements were made based on feedback and the sprint was completed, we pushed out to production. Occasionally further refinements were made based on customer support feedback as well as training calls.
      <p>
        A few months after the completion of the application I was able to conduct a few tests with clients. I mostly did naturalistic observational studying, but there were times I was able to ask users to complete a task for me. I already had data on some of the tasks that had been reported as difficult, so I came to these interviews with a list of processes I wanted to observe as clients worked to complete them
       </p>
        Currently, we make new features based on feedback from customer support. Every week I listen in on training calls, demos, and check-in calls to gather additional feedback. Every week we work with stakeholders to try to make sure things are working as planned.

        <h5>Roles</h5>
        I currently work here and the roles I take on are designer, usability specialist, and  quality analyst. I also help with the development of the companyâ€™s website using HTML and Sass.
